This enables you to upload your matches to sbbtracker.com
and contribute to the community dataset.

Things that are currently collected:
* Your steam name (this is not shared)
* Board states
* Placement
* Hero, Health, and XP
* Net MMR

This may include more game-related information as we improve 
our ability to collect it.

This info may be shared as part of the public dataset.

Would you like to import your old games? This is done by 
reading the record files generated by the game. This will 
import games going back to Dec 14 2021 (assuming you have not
deleted the record files).

Note that not all games are guaranteed to be imported.

If you have games already recorded from before Jan 2nd 2022
duplicated matches may appear. You may wish to backup and delete 
your current stats before doing this, or manually remove stats 
yourself.

The importer may take a long time to complete. Please be patient.
